Howell, Wiley Press, 1^st^ Ed. (Suggested) Course Description Design and manufacturing of flexible mechanisms. Biomechanics and bioinspiration. Kinematics and dynamics of robots and mechanisms. Mechanics and the effects of compliance on robot dynamics. Design optimization and system identification for flexible robots. Experimental validation of flexible robots. Course Objectives Having successfully completed this course, the student will learn the following: Using bio-inspired approaches in the development and design of mechanisms Understanding the kinematic relationships between forces and motion for rigid mechanical systems Understanding the relationships between force and deflection in flexible systems Being able to build and use physics-based models for understanding the dynamic motion of robotic systems Understanding how the limitations of fabrication processes translate to design constraints and guidelines for flexible systems. The basics of data collection and experiment design How to use optimization approaches in solving a robotics design problem. ME Department Objectives and Outcomes Coverage This course primarily contributes to Mechanical Engineering program outcomes that develop student abilities to: a. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics, b. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors, c. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences, e. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives, f. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions, g. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies, Course Organization Grading Item % Homework assignments and quizzes (6 counts -- initial prototyping, kinematics, dynamics, parameter identification, design optimization, final prototyping and testing) 20% Project 1 (initial prototyping of a flexible robot, kinematics modeling, dynamics modeling) 20% Project 2 (compliance modeling, design and manufacturing workflow, design optimization, experiment design, data collection and analysis) 20% Midterm exam 20% Final exam (includes all topics from the course, to be held during the final exam period) 20% Total 100% FZ Grade No FZ grade is given in this course. Homework Assignments There will be homework assignments throughout the course. The homework assignments are mostly going to be implemented in Python and its related packages. The homework assignments will be on (1) initial prototyping, (2) kinematics, (3) dynamics, (4) parameter identification, (5) design optimization, (6) prototyping and testing. The individual assignments are intended to introduce concepts discussed in class whereas the team projects are intended to reinforce the students on the concepts. Plagiarism and cheating will be severely punished . Term Projects There will be two projects within this course. The first project involves the initial design of a flexible robotic mechanism, an idealized kinematic analysis of the design and its dynamic modeling. The second project will include the effects of flexibility in the robot dynamics, the fabrication of a flexible robot, and its testing phases. The students have the option to redefine their designs in the second project. The groups will be given a fixed budget to complete the projects and will not be allowed to go over budget. The first project is expected to be theoretical whereas the second project is expected to be more practical. The students will make a demo of their second project at the end of the semester. Students will work in groups of 3-4. Exams Will include all topics from the course up to that point Will be held during the designated exam period / during a class period* * Specific date/time will be announced in advance. Make-up Exam Policy There will be no make-up exam unless a documentable extreme medical or family emergency exists. You must contact the instructor prior * to the exam, or no credit will be given for a missed exam. * 1 day notice minimum In-Class Laboratories and Tutorial Sessions In laboratory work, the students will apply the methods introduced in class to prototype simple flexible mechanisms as well as to learn validation techniques. In tutorials, the students will model and simulate robots in Python environment, apply optimization techniques, and perform system identification. Students are expected to come to the lab and tutorial sessions with a laptop capable of running Python. Course Policies Attendance Attendance will be taken during lectures and labs. Excused absences will be given for documented medical reasons, university-related travel, or job interview travel. Documentation must be in the form requested by the university (doctor report, travel ticket, etc.). It should also be noted that attendance is extremely important, and irregular attendance always results in poor or mediocre performance. Late Penalities Each concept in this class builds on the last, so failing to turn in an assignment on time affects you and your teammates. It is your responsibility to get in touch with the instructor regarding any questions before assignments are due. Late submissions will lose one letter grade(10%) for every day they are late. Any sumbission more than four days late will receive a zero. Course Honor Code Plagiarism and cheating are not acceptable in the classroom and will be severely punished. Specific Rules Do your own work for individual assignments and tests. Include the your sources of inspiration within assignments and projects. This will help grow the list of cool references, but more importantly, help distinguish inspiration from wholesale plagarism. Keep code/text/information you use from outside sources separate from your own original content (through the use of separate folders, for example). Make it explicit what is yours and what is not. Include all the licenses or copyright statements as required by the things you reuse. This will make your own code more reuseable for yourself and potentially others in the future. See academic handbook for more info. How to Succeed in this Course Attend all class sessions. Complete all pre-class preparation assignments and reading. Complete all post-class follow up assignments and reading. Participate in tutorial sessions and office hours. Check your school email regularly. Log in to the course websites at least once each week. Communicate proactively with your instructor. Create a study schedule so that you don\u2019t fall behind on assignments. Schedule The class schedule can be found on the course website.

Week 15/16 FINAL EXAM Course Logistics Software You will be expected to install and use either the Anaconda distribution of Python, or use google colab, for completing all assignments and following along in class. This class is friendly to all operating systems. Students have used Window, Ubuntu or OS/X on their own in the past with no problems. Please see the software list posted on the course site for more information about required and recommended software. The software listed is either open-source and freely available to download, available through Bilkent, or free for student use. Computers It is expected that you can bring a laptop to class to complete in-class programming tasks. Materials Students will be responsible for selecting and obtaining the consumable materials used in their project, such as cardboard, adhesive, plastic, etc. We may be able to supply a limited number of parts and materials which can be used for development, but if students wish to keep their robots they will need to purchase their own components. Equipment Special equipment for making laminate robots may be available for use on campus at your discretion. If you wish to use the tools and equipment you will need to pass all safety training required by the University.
